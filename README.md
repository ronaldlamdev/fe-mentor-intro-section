A project I created for Front End mentor to practice my responsive web design skills using React and Tailwind CSS. 
I started with desktop design then mobile later even though Tailwind is design for a mobile first approach as I felt desktop first was more natural.

#Future goals
-Learn more advanced React topics like more advanced hooks
-Improve Tailwind skills
-Try to work on mobile-first approach more
-Learn Next.JS maybe

#Useful sources
-Google
-Youtube
